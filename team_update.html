          <h4>Team News/Remarks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The 2015-2016 NASA USLI competition has officially reached an end. The
              team unfortunately did not get to participate on launch day due to a fifth
              full-scale launch failure. The failure occurred in Tifton, GA, as a part
              of Georgia Rockets in the Sky (GRITS). One of the fins came off which caused
              the rocket to enter a spin rapidly causing the payload fairing to crack
              and subcumb to aerodynamic forces causing it to peel off. But the team
              did walk away from the competition with the "TEAM SPIRIT" award. We are
              very thankful for this award and honored to bring recognition to the "Auburn
              Spirit." We look forward to the coming months preparing for next years
              competition! WAR EAGLE!</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="25MAR">25 March 2016</h2>
          <h4>Team News/Remarks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Our last launch in Manchester, TN, resulted in another motor CATO.
              <a href="http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com">Aerotech</a>, the manufacturer of the motor, has also accepted responsibility for
              this second CATO. To mitigate the risk of having a third motor CATO, NASA
              has granted us permission to switch to another motor. We will now be flying
              a Loki L1482-LB. For more info on other changes to the rocket, checkout
              our Documents section for our Flight Readiness Review documentation.</li>
            <li>The team hosted "Rocket Week" at Drake Middle School on 1-3 March 2016
              for the third straight year. It was a great chance to interact with over
              300+ students and to show them some of the science and engineering behind
              rockets. To learn more, checkout our Outreach page and view our photos
              on flickr!</li>
            <li>Our next launch is planned for 2 April 2016 in Tifton, GA, as a part of
              "Georgia Rockets in the Sky" (GRITS). This will be our last full-scale
              launch before the competition in April. If you would like to learn more
              about GRITS, please check out their website at
              <a href="http://www.gritslaunch.com">gritslaunch.com</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="22FEB">22 February 2016</h2>
          <h4>Team News/Remarks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A lot has happened in the last two weeks. The team has executed two more
              full-scale test flights.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The second full-scale test flight took place on 13 February 2016 in Samson,
                AL. This test had all payload systems (WAFLE and PLF) operation. Unfortunately,
                the rocket suffered a catastrophic failure in the propulsion system, otherwise
                known as a motor CATO. This failure was due in no part to any action, or
                lack thereof, by members of the team. Instead, the failure was due to a
                crack in the motor grain. At ignition, a piece of the grain broke away
                from the motor, along this crack, and embedded itself in the nozzle. This
                created a "plug", which lead to build up of pressure inside the motor casing.
                The "plug" was eventually ejected and the remaining gases created a force
                large enough to break the motor out of its retention system.
                <a href="http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com">Aerotech</a>, the manufacturer of the motor, has since accepted responsibility for
                the CATO.</li>
              <li>Check out the video of the launch below!</li>
              <li>The third full-scale flight took place on 20 February 2016 in Sylacauga,
                AL, as part of the Phoenix Missile Works event. The rocket had all systems
                operational. Unfortunately, the PLF suffered a failure during the boost
                phase of the flight. The PLF separated during the boost causing the drogue
                parachute to deploy as designed. Because the rocket was still in its boost
                phase, the drogue passed through the exhaust, melting the material. This
                caused the rocket to fall from apogee to main deployment without a droge.
                The recovery system ignited the main charges, separating the rocket into
                two separate pieces as designed. The rocket was nose down at this point
                meaning the explosive charge was not enough to deploy the parachutes against
                the atmospheric pressure. Video will be available in the next few days.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The next launch for Project Aquila will occur on 5 March 2016 in Manchester,
              TN.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Project Aquila successfully launched it's first full-scale rocket, dubbed
                  Aquila I! The launch was used as a verification for flight characteristics
                  versus simulation runs in similar conditions as well as testing of all
                  avionics equipment, including the instrumentation that will operate the
                  grid fins. All systems were deemed operational. The launch also provided
                  the team valuable flight data, as well as indicators to various system
                  weaknesses. These areas will be focused on and improved over the next two
                  weeks leading up to our next full-scale launch happening on 13 February
                  in Sylacauga, AL.</li>
                <li>Video from the full-scale launch can be viewed
                  <a href="media.html">here</a>!</li>
                <li>The team has also launched its official

                <li>Welcome back to all of our team members who were away for the holiday
                  break. The Project Aquila team has been extremely busy the last two weeks.
                  Two key items that are happening:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Critical Design Review documentation was posted this morning. Head over

                    Design Review, and how the design of our rocket has been evolving.</li>
                  <li>Fabrication of the full-scale rockets has commenced! Stay in close contact
                    with your team lead to stay in the loop on what tasks there are.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>With CDR out of the way, the team is focusing all of its effort on preparing
                  for the Flight Readiness Review milestone. Construction of full-scale versions
                  of the Project Aquila rocket have started. Multiple test flights will be
                  conducted over the next two months to validate full functionality of all
                  systems. Below is a table of current planned launch days and locations.</li>

              <h4>Team News/Remarks</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The proposal has been officially accepted by NASA, which means we have
                  exactly one month till PDR is due.</li>
                <li>With the proposal acceptance, NASA has requested that the locations for
                  the grid fins be shifted aft of the burnout CG. This will be addressed
                  tomorrow afternoon during the team meeting.</li>
                <li>Before conducting tests, please review and complete the checklist and
                  procedural write-up documents provided by Safety. Send to the SO for approval
                  prior to starting any testing.</li>
                <li>When executing testing, regardless of the method (simulations, physical
                  software and hardware testing, wind tunnel, etc.), perform the following:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Document everything such that anyone else on the team would be able to
                    recreate the test and achieve the same results</li>
                  <li>Record results using all media available (paper, pictures, videos, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
